These instructions are specifically for people who want to work on the backend -- the fleaflicker scrapers, database, and nodeJS.
It is highly recommended you DO NOT work on this, as the code is a bit of a jenga tower, but PM SPRX97 on Discord first if you insist.

These instructions will hopefully get a local copy up and running for contributors. It was written with a linux environment in mind, but should be pretty similar in windows. 
The tricky part would be getting mysql instead of sql server. If that isn't possible, I can host a copy of the prod database on my server for testing. Let me know what you think is easier.
If you have any suggestions for improving these instructions or streamlining the dev environment, feel free to ping me on discord!

Part 1: Copy Sql database
- Install mysql
- Get the test database dump from SPRX. This is a snapshot from an earlier prod database.
- Apply the dump with "mysql OldTimeHockey < oth.sql"
- Test access to the database by selecting and updating tables

Part 2: Fork git repository
- FORK my git repo from the github website.
- Clone your new fork using "git clone"

Part 3: Update shared/config_default.json file
- You'll have to update your config file to allow datatbase access.
- Update the path of your local roldtimehockey project
- Update the username and passwords for your login to your local instance of mysql.
- You shouldn't need the other logins, but if you think you do contact SPRX
- Then rename config_default.json to config.json.

Part 4: Install nodeJS and test local site
- Install nodejs
- Update "var noderoot" in header.html to point to your local node server 
- Run "node node/db_connection.js", then try viewing the html files
- If everything works, you should see the same stuff as the real site, just with stale data.
	- If it doesn't work, double check our config file or contact SPRX for help

Part 5: Make a minor change and commit
- Make a minor change and commit/push to your fork of the project
- On github, create a new pull request fore your change
- Contact SPRX to review/merge the pull request

Part 6 (Optional): Install python for scripts
- In order to get scripts running, you'll need an install of python3 and some dependencies
- You should be able to find all the dependencies in pip, but let me know if you can't find something
- If you're just working on the site itself you won't need to run these, so consider this optional.
	- You won't be able to run the bot anyway.
