Things to do at the beginning of a year:
✔️- Update scripts/WeekVars.txt
- Add rows to the "Leagues" table for each of the new leagues
✔️- Update homepage.js to include the previous years champions and new rule info
- Update TrophyRoom.js to include new banners (chizzle makes them)
- Run "UpdateTables.py" to grab all of the teams from each league (once the leagues are filled) -- normally this runs sunday night
✔️- Add the new year as a dropdown option in standings.js and make it the default
✔️- Add the new year (and previous playoffs) as options in leaders.js and increment the max value in NumSeasons
✔️- Add the new year as an option in ADP.js
- Uncomment the /etc/crontab lines for OTH (only do this the day the season starts)
- Turn "Less secure app access" ON for roldtimehockey gmail account (For playoff odds script)
