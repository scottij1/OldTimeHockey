TODO: Update this list based on 2022-23 (add registration automation stuff)
Things to do at the beginning of a year:
- Update scripts/WeekVars.txt
- Add rows to the "Leagues" table for each of the new leagues (scrips/SqlQueries/newleagues.sql)
- Update homepage.js to include the previous years champions and new rule info
- Update TrophyRoom.js to include new banners (chizzle makes them)
- Run "UpdateTables.py" to grab all of the teams from each league (once the leagues are filled) -- normally this runs sunday night
- Add the new year as a dropdown option in standings.js and make it the default
- Add the new year (and previous playoffs) as options in leaderboard.js and increment the max value in NumSeasons
- Add the new year as an option in ADP.js
- Uncomment the /etc/crontab lines for OTH (only do this the day the season starts)
- Clear/update the standings for the OT Challenge
- Update the year variable in DiscordBot/Config.json and OldTimeHockey/Config.json file
- Fix the "week" variable line in UpdateCurrentPF.py to account for the current season (the correct formuala to find the scoring_period for each week depends on what day of week the season starts on)
- Update the result of the IsPlayoffWeek method in react Helpers.js and is_playoff_week in scrips/Shared.py if necessary

Things to do at the end of a year:
- Turn off all cron scripts (except weekly backups)
- Turn off bot inactive reporting
- Update homepage.js with champions
- Update TrophyRoom.js with banners
- Update blacklist with quitters and team-droppers
